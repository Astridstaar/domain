        	If you are a company, .CO domains are the perfect way to build your company's presence on-line. .CO is the Internet top level domain intended to offer people and companies more choice in branding their online presence with a truly global, recognizable, and credible domain name. Associated globally with the words "COmpany," "COrporation" and "COmmerce" - the .CO domain is easy to recognize, simple to remember and flexible to use. And that makes it the perfect platform for today's socially networked individuals, entrepreneurs and companies to create .COmmunities, share .COntent, and .COnnect, .COmmunicate and .COllaborate.        	</p>
