        	If you are a networking technology company, .NET domains are the perfect way to build your company's presence on-line. .NET is the Internet top level domain derived from "network," indicating its intended purpose for organizations involved in networking technologies, such as Internet service providers and other infrastructure companies. It is still popular with network operators, and is often treated as an alternate to .COM.        	</p>
