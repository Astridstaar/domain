By registering your own domain, you have the opportunity to pick a short, easy to remember address that matches your site. And because each domain name is unique, you can keep your domain name no matter what service you use for hosting your site.</p>",
"common_js_facebox_faq_domain_why":"<h2><a class=\'faq\' name=\'why\'>Q</a>:Why should I register a domain name? </h2><p>Registering a domain name gives you the opportunity to choose a short, easy to remember Web address that matches your website.

With IMAP e-mail inboxes, you can download your mail to any computer using an e-mail client such as Outlook Express, Eudora Light, Netscape Messenger and others, and your mail is stored on the server. With a POP inbox, your e-mail is downloaded from the server to your local computer. (POP is better if you will only access your e-mail from one location.)
